# Readme

This is a c3d file format parser/reader written in rust. C3d is a biomechanics data format wildly used in the field of motion cpature.

The parser is written with the guidance of the [c3d.org](https://www.c3d.org/docs/C3D_User_Guide.pdf) specification and the python parser from [py-c3d](https://github.com/EmbodiedCognition/py-c3d).

> notice: This is still an early port, not all ANALOG parameter are tested, feel free to suggest any improvements. Residual bits are also not used to measure error rates too.
